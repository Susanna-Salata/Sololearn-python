## Spelling Backwards
Given a string as input, use recursion to output each letter of the strings in reverse order, on a new line.

Sample Input
HELLO WORLD https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/recursive%20function.py


## Letter Counter
Given a string as input, you need to output how many times each letter appears in the string.
You decide to store the data in a dictionary, with the letters as the keys, and the corresponding counts as the values.
Create a program to take a string as input and output a dictionary, which represents the letter count.

Sample Input
HELLO WORLD https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/letter%20counter.py


## Shooting Game
You are creating a shooting game!
The game has two types of enemies, aliens and monsters. You shoot the aliens using your laser, and monsters using your gun.
Each hit decreases the lives of the enemies by 1.
The given code declares a generic Enemy class, as well as the Alien and Monster classes, with their corresponding lives count.
It also defines the hit() method for the Enemy class.

You need to do the following to complete the program:
1. Inherit the Alien and Monster classes from the Enemy class.
2. Complete the while loop that continuously takes the weapon of choice from user input and call the corresponding object's hit() method.

Sample Input:
laser
gun
exit
