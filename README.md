My self-education tasks

## Longest Word
Given a text as input, find and output the longest word.

Sample Input:
this is an awesome text https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/longest%20word.py


## Spelling Backwards
Given a string as input, use recursion to output each letter of the strings in reverse order, on a new line.

Sample Input:
HELLO WORLD https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/recursive%20function.py


## Letter Counter
Given a string as input, you need to output how many times each letter appears in the string.
You decide to store the data in a dictionary, with the letters as the keys, and the corresponding counts as the values.
Create a program to take a string as input and output a dictionary, which represents the letter count.

Sample Input:
HELLO WORLD https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/letter%20counter.py


## Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics.
Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it.
For example, here is the Fibonacci sequence for 10 numbers, starting from 0: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34.

Write a program to take N (variable num in code template) positive numbers as input, and recursively calculate and output the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (starting from 0).

Sample Input:
6 https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/fibonacci.py


## Phone Number Validator
You are given a number input, and need to check if it is a valid phone number.
A valid phone number has exactly 8 digits and starts with 1, 8 or 9.
Output "Valid" if the number is valid and "Invalid", if it is not.

Sample Input:
81239870 https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/phone%20number%20validator.py


## Adding Words
You need to write a function that takes multiple words as its argument and returns a concatenated version of those words separated by dashes (-).
The function should be able to take a varying number of words as the argument.

Sample Input:
this
is
great

Sample Output:
this-is-great https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/adding%20words.py


## Juice Maker
You are given a Juice class, which has name and capacity properties.
You need to complete the code to enable and adding of two Juice objects, resulting in a new Juice object with the combined capacity and names of the two juices being added.
For example, if you add an Orange juice with 1.0 capacity and an Apple juice with 2.5 capacity, the resulting juice should have:
name: Orange&Apple
capacity: 3.5

The names have been combined using an & symbol. https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/juice%20maker.py 

## Shooting Game
You are creating a shooting game!
The game has two types of enemies, aliens and monsters. You shoot the aliens using your laser, and monsters using your gun.
Each hit decreases the lives of the enemies by 1.
The given code declares a generic Enemy class, as well as the Alien and Monster classes, with their corresponding lives count.
It also defines the hit() method for the Enemy class.

You need to do the following to complete the program:
1. Inherit the Alien and Monster classes from the Enemy class.
2. Complete the while loop that continuously takes the weapon of choice from user input and call the corresponding object's hit() method.

Sample Input:
laser
gun
exit
https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/shooting%20game.py


## Title Encoder

You are given a file named "books.txt" with book titles, each on a separate line.
To encode the book titles you need to take the first letters of each word in the title and combine them.

For example, for the book title "Game of Thrones" the encoded version should be "GoT".  https://github.com/Susanna-Salata/Sololearn-python/blob/main/title%20encoder.py





## Basketball Players

The given code includes a list of heights for various basketball players.
You need to calculate and output how many players are in the range of one standard deviation from the mean.
